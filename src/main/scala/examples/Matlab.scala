  // actually, Matlab APIs are JAVA APIs, so they expect Array, rather than Seq

  val another: Double = eng.feval("sum", Array(1, 2)) // work

  // besides type system, another tricky part of Matlab APIs is element order in Matrix, different from most high-level languages, Matlab is column-major, rather than row-major
  // but still, Matlab view rows as the first dimension, so you can easily put and get a 2-dimensional matrix without conversion

  // you can plot in scala, and view it in a pop-up
  eng.eval("plot([1,2], [3,4])")

  // generally, because of the type system conflicts(scala-static vs matlab-dynamic), using eval function with literal command may be a better choice
  // literal command work for consistently for Int,Double and Complex, while type system may fail
  eng.eval(s"y = fft(${time.toMatlabLiteral})")
